    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans: Functions are advantageous to have in programs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Functions allow you to write code once and use it multiple times throughout your program. \n",
    "    This makes your code more modular, easier to read and maintain, \n",
    "    and can save you time by reducing the amount of repetitive code you need to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions abstract away the details of how a particular task is accomplished,\n",
    "    allowing you to use the function without needing to know the implementation details. \n",
    "    This makes your code more high-level and easier to reason about, \n",
    "    and can help to prevent bugs by reducing the likelihood of making mistakes when implementing complex functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Functions can encapsulate related functionality into a single unit, \n",
    "    making it easier to manage and understand. This can help to keep your code organized and maintainable, \n",
    "    and can make it easier to debug issues when they arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Functions can be combined together to create more complex functionality. \n",
    "    This allows you to break down larger problems into smaller, more manageable pieces, \n",
    "    which can make your code more scalable and easier to work with over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, functions are a powerful tool for building robust and maintainable programs,\n",
    "and can help to improve the quality and efficiency of your code."

    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "Ans: The def statement is used to create a function in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for defining a function using the def statement is as follows:\n",
    "    def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Optional docstring\"\"\"\n",
    "    statements\n",

    "and its expected behavior. It is enclosed in triple quotes immediately after the function definition line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a function has been defined using the def statement, it can be called from anywhere in the program \n",

    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "Ans: A function and a function call are two distinct concepts in programming.\n",
    "    \n",
    "A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task, \n",
    "and can be called from other parts of a program. When you define a function, \n",
    "you give it a name and specify the input parameters that it accepts (if any), \n",
    "as well as the code that it will execute when called. Functions can return values or \n",
    "perform operations without returning anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function call, on the other hand, is the actual act of invoking or executing a function in your code. \n",
    "When you call a function, you use its name followed by parentheses, optionally passing in any arguments that it requires. \n",
    "The function call causes the code inside the function to be executed with the provided arguments, \n",
    "and can produce a return value if the function is designed to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task, \n",
    "while a function call is the act of invoking that code at a specific point in your program. "

    "Ans: \n",
    "A Python program has one global scope, which exists throughout the entire program.\n",

    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Ans: When a function call returns in Python, any variables defined within the local scope\n",
    "    of that function are destroyed, and the memory that they occupied is released back to the system. \n",
    "    This means that any variables, objects or data that was created or modified within the function\n",
    "    will no longer exist once the function has completed execution and returned.\n",
    "ex.\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "    print(\"The value of x inside the function is:\", x)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()\n",
    "print(\"The value of x outside the function is:\", x)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, a local variable x is defined within the my_function function. \n",
    "When the function is called, the value of x is set to 10, and the function prints its value. \n",
    "However, once the function returns, the variable x no longer exists, \n",
    "and attempting to reference it outside the function will result in a NameError.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above, the line print(\"The value of x outside the function is:\", x) will raise a NameError, \n",
    "because the variable x is not defined in the global scope of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is intentional, and helps to keep the program organized and \n",
    "prevent accidental name collisions between variables in different scopes. \n",
    "If you need to share data between different parts of your program, \n",
    "you can use return statements or global variables to accomplish this."

    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "Ans: In programming, a return value is the value that a function returns to the calling code \n",
    "when it has completed its execution. It represents the result of the functions computation or operation, \n",
    "and can be used by the calling code for further processing or to make decisions based on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a function can return a value using the return statement. \n",
    "The return statement is followed by the value that the function should return, \n",
    "and can be placed anywhere within the function body. \n",
    "When the return statement is executed, the function terminates \n",
    "and the returned value is passed back to the calling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following function that calculates the sum of two numbers:\n",
    "    def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "In this function, the return statement returns the sum of the input arguments a and b. \n",
    "When this function is called, the returned value can be stored in a variable \n",
    "or used in an expression like any other value:\n",
    "    result = add_numbers(3, 5)  # result is now 8\n",
    "    total = result + 10         # total is now 18\n",
    "So yes, it is possible to use a return value in an expression. \n",
    "The value returned by a function can be used in the same way as any other value in Python.\n"

    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "Ans: If a Python function does not have a return statement, or if the return statement does not specify a value, \n",
    "the function will return None by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "None is a special built-in Python value that represents the absence of a value. \n",
    "It is often used to indicate that a function has completed successfully without returning any meaningful data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following function:\n",
    "    def print_message(message):\n",
    "    print(message)\n",
    "This function takes a message as input, and prints it to the console using the print statement. \n",
    "However, it does not have a return statement. If you call this function and try to assign the result to a variable, \n",
    "you will get None:\n",
    "    result = print_message(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "    print(result)   # prints \"None\"\n",
    "In this example, the function print_message does not return a value, so the value of result is None. \n",
    "This behavior is consistent with the default return value of any Python function that does not explicitly return a value.\n"

    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Ans: In Python, if you want to access a global variable from within a function, \n",
    "    you can use the global keyword to declare the variable as global.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you declare a variable as global, any references to that variable within the \n",

    "as a global variable inside the my_function function. When the function is called, \n",
    "the value of x is set to 20, which modifies the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the function completes execution, the value of x is still 20, \n",
    "as the global variable has been modified by the function. \n",
    "The second print statement outputs the value of x as 20, w\n",
