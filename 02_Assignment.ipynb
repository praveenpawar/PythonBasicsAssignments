    "\"AND\" operator: This operator returns \"true\" only if both the operands are true, and returns \"false\" otherwise. \n",
    "                It is often represented by the symbol \"&&\" or the word \"AND\". \n",
    "                For example, the expression \"x > 5 && y < 10\" will return \"true\" only if the value of \"x\" is greater than 5 and the value of \"y\" is less than 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"OR\" operator: This operator returns \"true\" if at least one of the operands is true, and returns \"false\" if both operands are false. \n",
    "                It is often represented by the symbol \"||\" or the word \"OR\". \n",
    "                For example, the expression \"x > 5 || y < 10\" will return \"true\" if either the value of \"x\" is greater than 5 or the value of \"y\" is less than 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"NOT\" operator: This operator returns the opposite of the operands value. \n",
    "                If the operand is true, the \"NOT\" operator will return false, and if the operand is false, the \"NOT\" operator will return true. \n",
